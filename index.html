				About
			</p>
			<p class="entry">
				Hello! I am a computer scientist and software developer, currently based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where I study at Carnegie Mellon University. When I'm not in classes or working on a project, I enjoy hackathons, playing ice hockey, and reading about technology, physics and history. Right now, I am preparing for an internship with Microsoft in Redmond, Washington during the summer of 2014.

				I am part of the Class of 2017 at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I study Computer Science. In my classes at CMU, I have worked with the C programming language as well as Unix-based operating systems. I am considering double majors or minors in Business Administration, Robotics, and History.
				<br>
				<br>
				In 2013, I graduated from <a href="http://www.exeter.edu/">Phillips Exeter Academy</a> in my home state of New Hampshire. I took some of my first Computer Science courses at Exeter, and gained experience programming with C# and Java.

				Experience
			</p>
			<p class="entry">
				I started working at the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute's <a href="http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/projects/modsnake/">Biorobotics Lab</a> in 2013, where I am an undergraduate researcher under Dr. Howie Choset. Using C++ and Python, I work on firmware and communications software for the Modsnake project, which produces a modular snake robot capable of traversing terrain and obstacles impassible by humans and traditional robots. In addition, I also work with the snake hardware, repairing modules and building new parts.

				In the summer of 2012, I worked as a volunteer at the <a href="http://http://ctac-nh.org/">Computer Technology Assistance Corps</a>, a Manchester, New Hampshire based charity which supplies computers to schools, other charities, and low-income families. I was responsible for replacing failed components and installing new operating systems on the refurbished machines.
				<br>
				<br>
				Since the fall of 2013, I have also worked at Carnegie Mellon Computing Services' <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/computing/class-event/">Media Technology Services</a> department, where I repair and maintain the school's stock of audio-visual equipment.

				<a href="http://www.cmueats.com/">CMUEats</a> is a web app that <a href="http://oscarbezi.com/">Oscar Bezi</a>, Kirn Hans and I created at the HackCMU hackathon in September 2013. The site offers a quick and simple way to see what eateries on CMU's campus are open at any given time. The site was originally created with <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, but Oscar and I have rewritten it using <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and a <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> database. We have also added new features, such as the ability to see the time until the restaurant next opens or closes. CMUEats is still useful to the student body today, and obtains hundreds of views each week.
				<br>
				<br>
				CMUEats' source code is publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/bezi/cmueats">Github</a>.

				Caraccel is a mobile application for Android phones and tablets which allows drivers to track their vehicle's route and record accelerometer data for later review. I created this app in the fall of 2013 with a team of students as part of <a href="http://hackplus.acmatcmu.org/">Hack+</a>, a semester long program for new developers at CMU. My area of responsibility was integrating the app with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/">Google Maps Android API</a> and the device's GPS, allowing tracking on a real map. The application was created using Java.

				<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.justingallagher.awaretasks">AwareTasks</a> is an application for Android phones and tablets that Marco Alvarez, Luis Dominguez and I created at Phillips Exeter in the winter of 2013. The app is a reminders and task list app with a twist; as well as assigning your tasks a time to remind you, you can also specify a location where the app will remind you based on GPS data. The app was created using Java, and makes use of the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/">Google Maps Android API</a> to provide a visual and intuitive experience.
